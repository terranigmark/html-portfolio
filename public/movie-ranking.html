  <h1>The Best Movies According to Hector</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
      <h3>Stardust</h3>
        <p>A great movie that could make you think it's a classic Final Fantasy game.</p>
      <h3>Amelie</h3>
        <p>Heart-touching and fantastic movie about the importance of enjoying the life itself.</p>
      <h3>A Clockwork Orange</h3>
        <p>The movie has many lessons but my favorite one is that the human kind may find a cure for everything but itself.</p>
